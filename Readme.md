# Visual Recognition and classification of Car Damage for Insurance Claims

This project is an application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze images of cars involved in accidents to classify the type and severity of damage. Object detection and segmentation techniques are used to identify the damaged areas of the vehicle, and machine learning models are employed to classify the damage, such as scratches, dents, or broken windows. The application can automate the process of assessing car damage for insurance claims, reducing the time and cost associated with the claims process. The application can also be used by auto repair shops to estimate the cost of repairs and by car buyers to evaluate the condition of a vehicle they are considering purchasing.


## Instructions for running the application:

Install the required libraries as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Download the dataset and update the path in the code to the location where it is stored.
Run the python notebook file to train the model and evaluate the results.
To predict the type and severity of damage in a new car image, load the saved model weights and run the predict function on the image.
